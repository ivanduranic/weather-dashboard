# Weather Dashboard

This "Weather Dashboard" application was created using JavaScript, jQuery and OpenWeather APIs. It is a homework project, created while I'm attending the Web Development Course at UofT School of Continuing Studies.

## Visuals

![weather](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61889668/98499365-558f9f00-2217-11eb-8538-b73c63238c1e.jpg)

## Usage

User will notice following files: 'index.html','style.css' and 'script.js'. Also, there's a README file.
User can enter the name of any city and click on the button. He will immediately get the weather data for that city plus the forecast for the next five days. All the data's being stored in the Local Storage.
Link to a deployed application you can find here: https://ivanduranic.github.io/weather-dashboard/

## Support

I have used the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library while working with date and time and API key from https://openweathermap.org/ website.

## Roadmap

Weather Dashboard application will be updated and perfected as my knowledge progresses.
